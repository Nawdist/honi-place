## ‚ö† READ THIS CUTI ‚ö†
First of all, ‚ù§ HAPPY BIRTHDAY HONI ‚ù§

Ok so I was essentially planning to get this done about a month ago, but the framework I was using turned out to be pretty shit (mainly installer size + performance issues), But i only figured that out like 6 days ago, not only that but the Genshin data i gathered also became outdated. So basically i only put 10% of what i orginally planned

*Summary: Underestimated the time I needed, and the app is like half finished, but features are definetly comming soon (more on that [here](#features-to-come))*

## Finished Features

- Kiggy pic generator: generate (not so quite) infinite cat pictures with one click of a button woo!
 
- Kiggy gallery: Love the cats? Well you can save the pictures in a folder of choice and view them later!
 
- Genshin Character calendar: small calendar that tracks the birthdays of your favourite characters! (soon it'll be able to track some domains)

## Features to come:

- **Pocket Genshin wiki**: A tab that contains most of the important things you should know about the game (best weapons/artifacts/teams for a character, domains and their drops, etc...)

- **Art gallery**: A tab to create collections to put your art in, rate your performance, and see how you improve through time

- **Small helpful tools**: Such as color palette generator, palette extractor from other images, Wikipedia page extractor (could come in handy in school projects)
 
- **Cooking section**: Helpful tab to save and get cooking recipes.

- **Minigames**: Just some small minigames like tetris and snake
  
- **Some other junk**: Probably some useless inspirational quotes and randomly generated jokes.
  
***‚Äº I am always open to suggestions ‚Äº***
